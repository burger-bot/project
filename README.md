other developers know whatg they can do with your project.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred.  Badges let other
developers know that you know what you're doing.  Check out these badges
posted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they
all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to
contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so.  The 
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry
standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples
on how to run the tests here.
